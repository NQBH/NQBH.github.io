**Goal.** *I try to record some of my thoughts here.*

To be able to write well, I have to read a lot (damn this bloody dyslexia). I try to track my reading process carefully by [[NQBH's reading list/process](https://github.com/NQBH/hobby/blob/master/book/NQBH_book.pdf)]. [[TeX](https://github.com/NQBH/hobby/blob/master/book/NQBH_book.tex)].

To deal with my reading issue, I read by typing -- only good & hard books, of course. These are only my own materials to read, not violating any copyright laws.

Advanced Mathematics
======

**Why Do Mathematics?** Mathematics gives us a sense of meaning, a sense of order, a sense of being able to distinguish what is right & what is wrong, to avoid ambiguity & chaos, which are 2 of primal sources of depressions & other psychological problems.

Education
======

[en] I have been teaching some very-very basic classes in Elementary Mathematics, Elementary Physics, Elementary Chemistry, & Programming from Aug 2022, alongside my own research.

[vi] Bắt đầu từ cuối tháng 7, đầu tháng 8 năm 2022, tôi có mở 1 số lớp học thêm về Toán/Lý/Hóa Sơ Cấp, & Lập Trình cho học sinh ở quê mình. Thành thật mà nói, dẫu quay lại chốn này sau bao nhiêu năm, cảnh quang thay đổi, nhưng có những thứ muôn đời khó mà thay đổi, ẩn sâu hơn, khó nhìn thấy hơn, mà chắc có lẽ phải đi thật xa để trở về mới có thể nhìn ra nó rõ nét như vậy: đó là mặt bằng ý thức & dân trí cực thấp của dân quê, tính luôn cả học sinh & 1 vài giáo viên xấu tính. Tôi không có ý định chà đạp, bôi nhọ, chỉ có điều cái thứ mà tôi cảm nhận khi còn học cấp 2 đến giờ vẫn thế, không hề thay đổi.

**How can you teach a lazy uneducated student? Girl or boy worse?**

Game
======

I have played DotA 2 for some years now & I have some thoughts on it, especially on the moods it has brought to me.

Psychology
======

+ I think the only way to see through a thick mask of a person is to pretend that you are a loser to him/her to make him/her assume that he/she can do anything to you to satisfy his/her ego. The mask will be melt down instantly.

Reading
======

- I try to categorize books on my reading list according to their levels of difficulty. For those books which are easy to read & understand, I will read them whenever I feel not concentrated so much, e.g., hero-selection time before each DotA 2 match or minipause(s) within it. For those books which are in high level of difficulty & abstractness, I will read them whenever I feel empty, numb [Linkin Park's Numb] to fill these voids (of emotions or of meanings?) inside me.

------

Writing
======

I start to compose some secret drafts but the procrastination is great -- I cannot refuse it. What I feel is that it is not ripe enough to write. It needs more flavors.

### Some Personal Principles of Composition:

- Whenever I feel hesitation between 2 (or more) words, I will use a slash (slashes) between them to be able to defeat my procrastination in the matter of choosing the right word, also writer's block. I consider this principle as a linear combination (the most basic concept in Linear Algebra) of those words, or even a worse metaphor: interpolation spaces between Sobolev spaces in Mathematical Analysis -- not a good explanation, I know, but they are my best insights on this choice/style. Anyway, I can choose them later when my linguistics ability is improved.

- Always read & try to add some Wikipedia's (English version 1st, if not suitable, use Vietnamese one) about the subject I am writing. Wikipedia acts like a Google (mini-)map to what I try to discover.
