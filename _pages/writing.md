To be able to write, I have to read a lot (Damn this bloody dyslexia). I try to track my reading process carefully by [[NQBH's reading list/process](https://github.com/NQBH/hobby/blob/master/book/NQBH_book.pdf)]. [[TeX](https://github.com/NQBH/hobby/blob/master/book/NQBH_book.tex)].

To deal with my reading issue, I read by typing -- only good & hard books, of course. These are only my own materials to read, not violating any copyright laws.

NQBH's Writings
======

Some Personal Principles of Composition:

1. Whenever I feel hesitation between 2 (or more) words, I will a slash (slashes) between them to be able to defeat my procrastination in the matter of choosing the right word, also writer's block. I consider this principle as a linear combination (the most basic concept in Linear Algebra) of those words, or even a worse metaphor: interpolation spaces between Sobolev spaces in Mathematical Analysis -- not a good explanation, I know, but they are my best insights on this choice/style. Anyway, I can choose them later when my linguistics ability is improved.
