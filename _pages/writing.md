To be able to write, I have to read a lot (Damn this bloody dyslexia). I try to track my reading process carefully by [[NQBH's reading list/process](https://github.com/NQBH/hobby/blob/master/book/NQBH_book.pdf)]. [[TeX](https://github.com/NQBH/hobby/blob/master/book/NQBH_book.tex)].

To deal with my reading issue, I read by typing -- only good & hard books, of course. These are only my own materials to read, not violating copyright laws.

- G. H. Hardy. [*A Mathematician's Apology*](https://github.com/NQBH/hobby/blob/master/advanced_mathematics/Hardy2017/NQBH_Hardy2017.pdf). [[TeX](https://github.com/NQBH/hobby/blob/master/advanced_mathematics/Hardy2017/NQBH_Hardy2017.tex)]. Original: [Hardy2017](https://github.com/NQBH/reference/blob/master/Hardy2017.pdf). [An Annotated Mathematician's Apology](https://github.com/NQBH/reference/blob/master/Hardy2022.pdf).

- CÃ©dric Villani. [*Birth of A Theorem: A Mathematical Adventure*](https://github.com/NQBH/hobby/blob/master/advanced_mathematics/Villani2015/NQBH_Villani2015.pdf). [[TeX](https://github.com/NQBH/hobby/blob/master/advanced_mathematics/Villani2015/NQBH_Villani2015.tex)]. $\partial_t f + {\bf v}\cdot\nabla_{\bf x}f = \int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\int_{\mathbb{S}^2} |{\bf v} - {\bf v}_\star|[f({\bf v}')f({\bf v}_\star') - f({\bf v})f({\bf v}_\star)]{\rm d}{\bf v}_\star d\sigma$.
