**A brief self-description.** `some adjectives` highly introverted, highly sensitive, honest, minimalist but/thus (?) informative; `some noun phrases` dyslexia/reading disorder, a disagreeable giver (used to be an agreeable giver before having been psychologically manipulated), a broken eidetiker.

My Vietnamese full name is **Nguyễn Quản Bá Hồng**. My publication name as a scientist/mathematician is **Nguyen Quan Ba Hong**, or **Hong Quan Ba Nguyen**. I do not & will not use **Hong Nguyen** since there are too many Vietnamese girls with that name &, as a human being, a PDE-researcher also, I prefer the uniqueness in literally anything which I am interested about. I also have another name called by my family: **Nguyễn Quản Trung Nhân**, i.e., *"người trung thực"*, nhưng cũng có thể chỉ là *"kẻ trung bình"*.

I no longer believe in the adjective *"professional"*. Now whatever I work on is considered as a pure love & hobby. Doing something as a hobby in a professional way is much better than doing some professional job as a hobby.

I used to believe that Mathematics is my life & only Mathematics can be considered like that, but now, after having increased my awareness & perception, I realize that this idea & the old me are bullshit. I have negated many parts of myself to be able to move forward. *Why only work on something? To limit your mind or what?* Embrace yourself. Let this thirst/craving for the blood of knowledge invade us. Now I work on, as pure hobbies, a much wider horizon of different fields in science.

**E-mail.** <nguyenquanbahong@gmail.com> (also the `Email` button in the sidebar).

**Curriculum Vitae (CV).** [NQBH's CV](https://github.com/NQBH/miscellaneous/blob/master/CV/NQBH_CV.pdf) (also [CV](/cv/) page in the navigation topbar but not including latest updates & details as in the PDF).

**NQBH's library.** [NQBH/reference](https://github.com/NQBH/reference) & my [BibTeX file](https://github.com/NQBH/reference/blob/master/bib.bib). Almost all of the references I am reading are uploaded & stored in this GitHub repository. There are some very large files (>> 50 MB) which I cannot upload due to GitHub's maximal filesize. I will list them in [NQBH/reference/oversized file](https://github.com/NQBH/reference/blob/master/oversized_file) & consider to store it later in [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) if needed & reasonable.

**NQBH's YouTube channel.** [YouTube/NQBH](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKFOGpBNuVW3Rz8s_ps2kg) & some notes on its content can be viewed here [NQBH/hobby/YouTube](https://github.com/NQBH/hobby/tree/master/YouTube).

> "The 2 most important days in your life are the day you are born & the day you find out why." -- Mark Twain

> "The essence of mathematics lies in its freedom." -- Georg Cantor

> "It is true that a mathematician who is not somewhat of a poet, will never be a perfect mathematician." -- Karl Weierstrass

(The doube *"ss"* in the end of Weierstrass's name should be the character ß, i.e., beta-like symbol, in his original name in German. Trust me: I knew it since I worked at Weierstrass Institute in Berlin, Germany for 1.5 years.)

> "In this world, is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law? Is it like the hand of God hovering above? At least it is true that man has no control, even over his own will. Man takes up the sword in order to shield the small wound in his heart sustained in a far-off time beyond remembrance. Man wields the sword so that he may die smiling in some far-off time beyond perception." -- Kentaro Miura, Berserk, Vol. 1

> "Providence may guide a man to meet 1 specific person, even if such guidance eventually leads him to darkness. Man simply cannot forsake the beauty of his own chosen path. When will man learn a way to control his soul?" -- Kentaro Miura, Berserk

[Blog](https://github.com/NQBH/hobby/tree/master/blog)
======
[NQBH's principles for blogging](https://github.com/NQBH/hobby/blob/master/blog/NQBH_principles_for_blogging).

I list my blog posts *chronologically*. Bloggers usually use *reverse chronological order* instead, i.e., the newest blog post appears 1st then older & older, & then the oldest post -- like an updated list of achievements in CV. I use chronological order here due to the development process of my mindset, & I think this order is more reasonable.

(Actually, LaTeX's package `babel` will handle nicely the problem of switching between English & Vietnamese in these templates, thus there is no `LaTeX_template_book_Vietnamese` listed here).

Miscellaneous

* *How to build NQBH's GitHub Page, i.e., [nqbh.github.io](https://nqbh.github.io/)?* A detailed construction (with bugs) can be viewed at [NQBH's GitHub Page](https://github.com/NQBH/hobby/blob/master/NQBH_GitHub_page/NQBH_GitHub_page.pdf). Status: `still in writing ...`.

* I love *animes, manhwas, movies, musics, quotes*, etc. -- literally anything which can be considered as an emotion generator. Here is my favorite watching & reading list: [NQBH's collection of anime, movie, music, quotes, etc.](https://github.com/NQBH/hobby/tree/master/NQBH_GitHub_page). Status: `still in writing ...`.

* I used to love to draw. Here are some drawings in 2014 -- when I was 18 years old:

![NQBH's drawing/Hulk](/images/Hulk_3.jpg "Hulk")

![NQBH's drawing/random man](/images/man_2.jpg "A random man")

I will store other drawings at [NQBH/hobby/drawing](https://github.com/NQBH/hobby/tree/master/drawing) if I draw/paint again.
